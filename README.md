# The Spreadsheet Quest

This repository tells the history of a quest for achieving a *pythonic* code to read a spredsheet representing a credit card statement.

I wrote it to give a talk at a PythonRio meetup on 30th July 2016.

Each commit is a step forward.

## Guide

In the doc directoy you can find a guide.pdf with all the steps of the adventure.
